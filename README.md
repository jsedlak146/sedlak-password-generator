# sedlak-password-generator

## Description

For this challenge, we were asked to use JavaScript to create a functional randomized password generator.  This could be used for many security based applications, such as secure sites like mobile banking, or for employee log in information. Below are my URLs.

## Installation

I started by pseudocoded to get an idea of what I wanted to do and how to fulfill the requirements of the project

## Usage

To use the password generator, start by clicking the "Generate Password" button.  You will then be prompted to select the length of your password, nd the types of characters it contains.  If your password does not meet the necessary criteria, it will not be generated.  If it does meet criteria, your randomized password will appear in the box.
